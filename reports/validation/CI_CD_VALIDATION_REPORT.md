## Conclusion

The Tiger MCP system has excellent foundation infrastructure but requires immediate attention to implement proper CI/CD automation. The Docker configurations, testing framework, and deployment scripts are production-ready, but the absence of GitHub Actions workflows creates a significant gap in the development lifecycle.

**Next Steps:**
1. Implement GitHub Actions workflows (highest priority)
2. Set up automated testing and security scanning
3. Create staging environment and deployment pipeline
4. Add monitoring and alerting capabilities

The project is well-positioned for rapid CI/CD implementation due to its solid foundation and comprehensive tooling infrastructure.
